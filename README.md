# Flexbox Grid

This is a super light weight flexbox grid system. It's based on Bootstrap grid and maintains an almost identical class naming structure to make
swapping it in / out of projects that bit easier and make using it a lot less of a mental burden as flexbox is enough of that already. 

Pull the project in via Bower and include the `grid.less` file in your project.
